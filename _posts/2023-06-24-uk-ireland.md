A three week trip to the UK and Ireland in the middle of summer to see all of the beautiful things here, including friends from home who are living in this part of the world. I planned a nice long holiday piggybacking off Ruby's work trip to visit collaborators in Edinburgh. A week there, and a few more days over the weekend to see the Scottish Highlands together. Then for me it was on to Ireland, followed by a week in England, before making my way back to Helsinki.

### Scotland

I remember thinking it was so nice that I was travelling in a fun new country where they spoke english. Made life so much easier when you can talk to everyone there without feeling guilty about potentially offending them (a refreshing change compared to recent travel). So we're off to a good start already. A week in Edinburgh is a long time, so it was also a welcome change of pace. More time chilling out, slowly seeing all of the things along the Royal Mile, and not worrying too much about missing out on anything. 

Ruby and I got in on the weekend and were able to spend a day together before her work visit started. We took the train from Edinburgh to Newcastle on the Sunday and enjoyed walking about there. Had a roast there for dinner and tried a Yorkshire pudding for the first time (that I can remember). The next day I was off alone. After new city free walking tour that I usually do, it was just aimlessly strolling the streets and finding fun new things. Over the next few days I did day trips to coastal towns (North Berwick), a few runs to the coast, missed out on the opportunity to see Puffins, and walked into way too many stores selling woolen sweaters. Turns out I don't like black pudding even though it tastes somewhat fine, that the second row of a comedy show is not far enough back to avoid heckling from the MC.

After Edinburgh we drove up to Inverness through the Scottish Highlands, making lots of nice stops along the way. Once in the original and inferior Perth, another time in Balmoral to see how the royal family live it up, and at various points once we were in the highlands to take in the incredible landscapes. We stayed in a lovely B&B in a small town called the Muir of Ord, with two cute and playful border collies. A wholesome base for seeing the highlands and lochs, before the rushed drive back to Edinburgh to catch our flights going separate ways.

### Ireland

A surprise favourite of mine this trip despite all of the rainy weather and grey skies. The unbelievable landscapes, lovely company, lively nightlife, and warm welcoming vibes made Ireland one of the best places I've been this year. (And I'm writing this post after an additional few months of travel.) I'll admit Belfast was a bit strange. The first thing I saw after arriving was something being lit on fire in a skate park. Hooligans and teenages I assumed. I only learned about the past conflicts and lingering tensions after a few tours and chats with new friends from the hostel. But yeah as a tourist it's all fun with trips to the beautiful northern coastline, pubs with live folk music, and friendly travellers from other parts of the world. Nothing to worry about.

From Belfast I went to Galway which is on the west coast. That's where I copped most of the stormy weather. Except for the one day I booked an amazing tour to go see the Cliffs of Moher and Aran Islands. Somehow lucked out and had the most incredible time cycling around Inisheer, admiring the cliffs, and cruising the patch of Atlantic Sea between them with perfect sunny weather. I spotted my first Puffin too! It was sitting on the surface of the water and we spotted them along with other seabirds from the boat. So really it was just a blob of orange beak but it counts. We celebrated a perfect day with a guinness at the pub, as you (and everyone else) do in Ireland.

All of my stuff was already damp on the next day so I decided to go for a run to maintain some level of fitness. The rain picked up, and I thought it would be most pretty along the coast where there was no shelter to block my view. I was right - there was no shelter and I got drenched. I was able to spot a large seal swimming in a little stream that passes through the city though, so all worth it. The rest of that day was spent indoors talking to more kind strangers.

I did the bulk of my drinking in Dublin - the last stop of my Ireland holiday. It was great to catch up with a friend I made earlier in the trip, Tasny, who studied there for a semester on exchange. She was able to show me around Temple bar, where we checked out the oldest pub in Ireland and tried guinness, irish whisky, and Jameson from their distillery. I think guinness is actually more tasty in Ireland. I've had it a few times in other parts of the world now and there just seems to be something missing and different. Relaxing and drinking was a happy way to finish up in Ireland.

### England

The flight from Dublin to Bristol was delayed and set off a chain reaction of unfortunate events. The bus I booked from the airport to Bath, where I planned on staying a night, did not show up at 1am. I lucked out and met other travellers going that way, so we shared a taxi there. I got to the hostel I booked, and to my surprise they wouldn't let me check in. Strict 11pm latest check in despite the staff all being there hypothetically allowing me to check in (and unfortunately it did say this in the email I didn't read). They suggested another place, which was full. As was every other place in the city. So yeah a night roughing it. Luckily not alone - somebody else caught the same flight and bus (which did show up after all), booked the same hostel, and found themselves in the same situation. Made it through the night and everything was fine, but I'll have to come back to see Bath properly another time in a better mood :)

The main point of coming to England was to catch up with friends. Mainly Tim who moved to London for work, and Mitch who is finishing off a PhD in Cambridge. It was also nice to get to know Katie (Tim's gf) who I met only briefly before she moved to London. Anyway these few days were filled with relaxing time catching up and doing chill stuff like we were all in Perth (except punting which was a Cambridge exclusive). Drinks, sharing meals, comedy, random wandering around nice areas of town, and runs with Tim where I struggle to keep up. Every day with them was just so great.
