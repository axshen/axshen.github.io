There is lots of incredible diving in Coron. It is the place to go for WW2 wrecks, there are a number of freshwater lagoons, and there is Barracuda Lake which is one of the best freediving spots in the world. I had originally planned to spend two weeks here, but the TAO Expedition ate into that time (no complaints). So much to do and only one week to see it all. In the end I was only able to squeeze in one day for scuba diving (two wrecks and a local reef), and only managed to get hold of an instructor for two days of freediving. The rest of the time was spent eating and drinking with new friends, and safely exploring the island.

### Barracuda lake

I loved Barracuda lake so much that I am going to give it a special mention. I haven't been freediving all that long, nor have I been to many places for it. But it's hard to imagine freediving locations getting much better than this. Warm, fresh, water and calm conditions meant no wetsuit, no weight belt, or struggles with the breathe-up. Beautiful limestone cliffs to admire both above and below the water. There's this strange but comforting thermocline at ~15m which separates the cooler (still ~30 degrees), fresh water layer from the warmer (35 degrees +) salt water layer. It acts as a nice reference point for your dives, and a cosy little hug as you descent into the depths. To top it off, a curious and friendly barracuda lives in the lake and follows you around flexing its breath holding ability. Would happily dive here day after day.
