A work trip to the east coast to meet with people from Data Central (AAO) in Sydney, turned holiday in Melbourne over the ANZAC and Easter long weekends. It was nice to stay with my Cousin (Brett) and his partner Michelle, and Eddie, while over in Melbs. A slower holiday than usual with many days of just chilling out with friends and walking aimlessly around town :) Also trying a new blog format following a conversation Eddie and I had at coffee - maybe people will like the images with captions more, and less of my rambling!
