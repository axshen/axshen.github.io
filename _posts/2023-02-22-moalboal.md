Moalboal is a small coastal town on the far east side of Cebu, and was my first stop in the Philippines. I came here to see the sardine run, which could be found just 20 metres from the beach where the reef would sharply drop-off to 50+ metres. None of the photos captured how large the schools were, or how they would seem to swallow you as you dove down through. There were also turtles, clownfish, sea snakes, and stonefish living on the reef. So much marine life to see, and all of it accessible without any scuba equipment or a mammoth breath-hold.

I ended up really enjoying Moalboal for so many reasons other than the sardine run. The hostel had a great vibe which made it easy to meet other travellers, all of the food places were delicious, and there were a cool waterfalls to see!
